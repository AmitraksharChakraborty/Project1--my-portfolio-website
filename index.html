            <h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>
            <div>
            <h4>Participated in Smart India Hackathon (SIH)</h4>
            Our project’s name is FORGERY PREVENTION ( statement titled Student Innovation)|| The main objective of the project is to protect petrol stations from forgery made by the cars having forge number plates. The proposed system will be able to detect the authenticity of the number plates and based on the results received from the remote database through IoT, it will allow or reject the car to fill-up the car tank.
            <h5>
            I built  a dummy database with SQL and made the path so that If the number plate data matches with the database, an authentication signal is sent to the main server to activate the associated mechanism to open the entry gate. (I have Used Technology: SQL, XAMPP,PHP )
